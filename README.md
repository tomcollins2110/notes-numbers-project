Numbers 'n Notes! Intro: Welcome to my second project, titled "Numbers 'n Notes", this is a handy games night assistant. The site has 3 main features all of which are easy to use, designed and laid out in a clear and concise manner. The games night assistant contains a handy Day/Night mode toggle switch, a random number generator and a notepad. The website is responsive so it's even handy for using on the go on a mobile device. The day/night switch can be used to dim the screen depending on the users preferrence.

Features:

The first feature is a simple but handy Day/Night mode toggle which is a very popular feature now on lots of sites and apps. This gives the user the ability to dim the brightness of the screen by changing the colors to a more "night time" acceptable styling. This feature is often preferred as lots of users claim it to be more comfortable to look at.
The second feature is a random number generator which can be substituted for a dice. This feaure was relatively easy to include but adds quite a bit to the functionality of the website.
The third feature is the notepad. The user can input notes of various lengths and they will all appear promptly below the input area, for viewing. The notes are displayed as written and then can be double clicked to delete. The list can also be cleared entirely with a simple refresh of the page.


Testing: 

⦁ JavaScript. The Javascript part of this project revolves around the note maker while there are additional added features of a random number generator and a day/night switch. This was quite an interesting part of the project over all as it was very difficult at the start for me to figure out the steps javascript takes in order to execute. But upon reading it and working through the process again and again, now I am significantly more able to understand and visualise how the code works. But I still wanted to keep this part simple enough to avoid too many issues or complications when working on the project. 

⦁ HTML. Since the project isnt too complex, you can imagine it was quite easy to get the HTML code working perfectly without any issues. 

⦁ CSS. As for the CSS honestly I think this was the hardest part of the project for me. With functions and such, I can kind of imagine the funtions and variables working as I write them, while in CSS I find it alot harder to picture the design as I want it and implement that in my design. I eventually felt I had to abandon some idea designs in the end as I couldn't get them working perfect. I found I had either repeated alot of styling in CSS or had the wrong styling in the wrong elements. Nonetheless, looking over the code a few times I was able to get it working okay and orgainised decently I think.

Deployment: This site was deployed using GitHub pages, following the steps of:

In the git repository, go to the settings tab.
From the "source section" drop down menu and select the "Master Branch".
When the master branch has been selected the page will automatically refresh with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the succesful deployment.

For this project I took inspiration from the walkthorugh project "love maths" but also other online resources. I spend some of my down time watching you tubers who 
code and are able to explain what they are doing well. 
I took inspiration for the note maker from :
